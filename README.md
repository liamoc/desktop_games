# Micro Entertainment Pack

This is the source code to the Micro Entertainment Pack, a collection of tiny desktop games I made for fun. If you're just interested in playing the games, probably better head over to [my itch.io page](http://liamoc.itch.io). I try to maintain builds for Linux, Windows, and macOS but macOS is the easiest for me to support.

All games are made using Rust and my [tesserae](https://crates.io/crates/tesserae/) library for graphics composed out of 8x8 2 colour tiles. All of the games in the pack use a common tileset to do all of their graphical drawing. All graphics were drawn using the tesseraed editor that comes with the library. I also used this tileset to build the icons and cover art for the game, along with effects from Affinity Photo.

For input handling, rendering of graphics, etc, I use the cross-platform SDL2 libraries.

# Building


*The makefiles and build scripts in this repository are for building bundles and deploying them to itch.io*. They are not for building the games themselves. To do that, you can just use cargo, like any other Rust project.

You will need SDL2 installed on your system in some form or other. Rust's sdl2 crate does support bundled SDL2 but I haven't investigated this as it's not needed for my use case.

Obviously you will also need rustc and cargo, I recommend installing it via rustup.

Cargo should build binaries out of the box just by running cargo build. 

# Contributing

These games are all open source, with code under BSD3 and the icons and tile set under CC0. I naturally welcome contributions, *HOWEVER*:

- These games were all made quickly and simply. Often they're all just in one file. I acknowledge that the code may not be the most elegant or beautiful, but it also doesn't have to be. Criticism of programming style will be ignored. 
- I am loathe to increase the complexity of these games significantly. Adding new features will be done cautiously if at all.
- Any pull request that increases the dynamic library dependency footprint of the games will be rejected. The more dependencies, the higher the maintenance burden. Please keep that in mind.
- I am not a big believer in codes of conduct or other moral formalism, but I do expect contributors to meet a level of standard decency: not being a mysogynist, nazi, white supremacist, transphobe or homophobe is a good start. I will refuse contributions from people who fall short of these standards.
